# Legend of Lua

This is an open-source Love2D Zelda-like game.

This project can be run like any other Love2D game. For instructions on this process, see my video on installation and setup:

As of 10/13/2022, all future updates will be applied to a different repo that is not open-source. This is necessary so I can hire artists to create assets and purchase professionally made sprites, sound effects, and music. I am not allowed to re-distribute those types of assets, so unfortunately, they cannot exist in an open-source repo. However, all releases from this private repo will be archived here in the _releases folder.
